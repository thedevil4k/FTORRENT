# 📖 User Guide - FTorrent

Welcome to FTorrent! This guide will help you take your first steps with the lightest and most powerful torrent client.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1.  **Run the application:** Open the `FTorrent.exe` executable.
2.  **Initialize Session:** When you open it for the first time, you will see the main interface. The download engine starts automatically.
3.  **Configure Downloads:** Go to `Preferences` (gear icon) and choose your default download folder.

## 📥 How to Add Torrents

You have two ways to start downloading:

### 1. .torrent Files
Click the **"+"** icon or the `Add Torrent` button. Select the file from your computer and accept.

### 2. Magnet Links
Click the `Add Torrent` button, paste the magnet link in the corresponding field, and accept.

## ⚙️ Network Settings

To get the best performance, you can adjust:

-   **Download Limit:** Useful if you want to browse while downloading.
-   **Upload Limit:** Recommended to leave some room to not saturate your connection.
-   **Ports:** FTorrent uses UPnP to open ports automatically, but you can configure it manually in the Preferences.

## 📊 Understanding the Interface

-   **Torrent List:** Shows the name, size, progress, speed, and status of each download.
-   **Status Bar:** At the bottom, you will see the total speed of your connection and the session status.
-   **Control Icons:**
    -   ▶️ **Resume:** Starts the selected download.
    -   ⏸️ **Pause:** Temporarily stops the download.
    -   🗑️ **Remove:** Removes the torrent (you can choose to also delete the downloaded files).

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Where are my files saved?**
By default in your system's download folder, but you can change it in the Preferences.

**Why is my download not progressing?**
Make sure the torrent has "Seeds". Without seeds, there is no one sharing the complete file.
