# 📖 User Guide - FTorrent

Welcome to FTorrent! This guide will help you take your first steps with the lightest and most powerful torrent client.

## 🚀 Quick Start

## 📥 How to Add Torrents

You have two ways to start downloading:

## ⚙️ Network Settings

To get the best performance, you can adjust:

-   **Download Limit:** Useful if you want to browse while downloading.
-   **Upload Limit:** Recommended to leave some room to not saturate your connection.
-   **Ports:** FTorrent uses UPnP to open ports automatically, but you can configure it manually in the Preferences.

FTorrent can run in the background:
-   **Minimize to Tray:** Closing the window or clicking minimize (if configured) will move FTorrent to the system tray.

-   **Status Bar:** At the bottom, you will see:
    -   **Total Speed:** Combined download and upload rates.
    -   **Resource Monitor:** Real-time RAM consumption of the application.
    -   **Session Status:** Indicates if the engine is running or paused.
-   **Control Icons:**
    -   ▶️ **Resume:** Starts the selected download.
    -   ⏸️ **Pause:** Temporarily stops the download.
    -   🗑️ **Remove:** Removes the torrent (you can choose to also delete the downloaded files).

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Where are my files saved?**
By default in your system's download folder, but you can change it in the Preferences.

**Why is my download not progressing?**
Make sure the torrent has "Seeds". Without seeds, there is no one sharing the complete file.
